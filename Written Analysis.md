# Surf's Up 

## Overview of Project
The project studies the temperatures on the island of Oahu.

### Purpose

**Analytical:** In this project I analyze the temperature and precipitation on an island of Hawaii to determine the sustainability of opening a business (ice-cream/surf shop) which would inherently do well in higher temperatures.

**Technical:** I employ the pandas, sqlalchemy and numpy libraries within python, to extract data from dataframes without having to load the entire data.

## Results

All islands of Hawaii fall in the northern hemishpere, however they're extremely close to the equator (19.9Â° N) therefore they lie in the Torrid[^1] zone.

The weather in Torrid zones is warm throughout the year, instead of summers and winters, these regions have a wet and dry season[^2]. June being the peak dry month and December being the peak wet month. Precipitation and temperature data from these two months can be analyzed to create a business model (as they'll represent the extreme cases of the 2 possible weather scenarios affecting a ice-cream/surfing business)

#### Conclusion
 1. December receives higher precipitation than June
 2. June has higher temperatures than December
 3. 

| City Type | June | December |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Temperature | Average precipitation |
| Precipitation | 1.3 : 1 |
| Rural | 1.6 : 1 |
